# Golfweek App

## Setup

* install [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
    * for rvm use the ```Install RVM with stable ruby``` option (3rd command down)
    * install node version 0.10.x as some of the node modules don't work with v0.11.13
* clone the repository and ```cd golfweek_app```
* run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies
* now you are ready to start working
* all of the editing should be done in the src folder _not_ the dist folder
* you can view your work with auto reload at localhost:1337
